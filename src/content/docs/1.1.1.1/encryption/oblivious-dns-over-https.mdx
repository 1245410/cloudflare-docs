As announced on [our blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/), since late 2020, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 supports Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH) ([RFC 9230](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9230.html)).

ODoH is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution via the OHTTPS protocol ([RFC 9230](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9230.html)), which improves privacy by separating the contents of an HTTP request (and response) from its requester IP address.
